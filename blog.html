            <h2>Q1.Difference between local storage and session storage ?</h2>
            <P> <strong>Ans:</strong> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
                localStorage doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            <h2>Q2.Difference between global scope and block scope ?</h2>
            <P> <strong>Ans:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as
                global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope.
                The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these
                curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to
                refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</P>

            <h2>Q3.How will work javascript event loop?</h2>
            <P> <strong>Ans:</strong> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback
                Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</P>

            <h2>Q4.How many ways we will get 'undefined' in javascript?</h2>
            <P> <strong>Ans:</strong> undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global
                scope. The initial
                value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
                In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is
                not the case, avoid overriding it.)
                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                undefined if a value was not returned.
